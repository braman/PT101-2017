Week 4
======================
1. Quiz results review (Q/A)
2. Homework check
3. Chapter 4:
3.1 - principles of structured programming
3.2 - algorithm (actions + order) or program control or control statements
3.3 - pseudocode (or algorithm skeleton), an abstraction language between human, algorithm and real program
3.4 control structure (Bohm and Jacopini research - sequence structure, the selection structure and the
repetition structure)
3.4.1 - sequence structure (UML activity diagram as an alternative to pseudocode)
3.4.2 - selection statement(if, if ... else, switch), UML
3.4.2.1 - single selection (one if)
3.4.2.2 - double selection (if ... else)
3.4.2.3 - multiple selection (switch)
3.4.3 - repetition statement(or loops) - while, for , do ... while, UML
3.4.4 - examples for all above statements, Dangling-else Problem, using code blocks
3.4.5 - counter controlled repetition statement (or definite repetition), consider example 
(pseudocode and java program)
3.4.6 - sentinel controlled repetition or indefinite repetition
(sentinel value = end of data entry)
3.4.7 - implicit and explicit type casting for primitives
3.4.8 - compound assignment operators (figure 4.16)
3.5 - GUI - drawing lines
