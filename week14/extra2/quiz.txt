A. Create a abstract class Car which has information about the type of car 
(this should be enum type called CarType and contain values like Hatchback, 
SUV, Sedan, sport car, etc.), engine hourse power, color. 
Create a non-zero constructor which will accept all this information.
Example:
abstract class Car {				enum CarType {
	public data_type name;				....
}									}

B. Create a class called SportCar which will inherit from Car class and 
should have properties like year of production, cost and abstract method 
called getMaxSpeed which will return int type. Create an indirect
child of Car class which will inherit from SportCar class called Bugatti.
Bugatti class should have no-argument constructor and the color of one 
should be red and year of production should be 2017, hourse power 1000,
and max speed of one is 350.
